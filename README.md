# FVM-Speech-Tools
Developer Tools to enable conversational interface development with speech synthesis for the Filecoin eco-system. 

# Details 

FVM Speech Tools are developer tools that enables FVM smart contract designers, developers and community managers to integrate speech synthesis, conversational interface and internationalization for their filecoin enabled dapps or infrastructure, developer tooling.  

We have also used Tableland and Tellor to create a task notifier and a reference notes dapp with the developer tooling module for speech synthesis enablement for Filecoin eco-system dapps. Tellor enables us to interact securely and obtain data from off-chain sources like OSS Wordnet dictionary.

FVM analytics toolkit enables data tabulation, organization, validation and visualization of on-chain data using an OSS spreadsheet.  Our toolkit enables a speech interface for dapp developers to integrate it within their solution as a low code framework to empower Web3 users via speech synthesis and internationalization.


# How we built it

We developed the speech synthesis toolkit using open source TTS (text to speech) engines, interface using JS frameworks and are developing on-chain integrations to hyperspace testnet and mainnet to support FVM based dapps. We also integrated an FVM analytics toolkit built using an OSS spreadsheet for data tabulation, organization, collaboration of FVM data.

We built the developer tooling for alarm and task notifiers, reference notes dapp using Tableland and OSS JS frameworks. This dapp serves as a notes section for the conversational interface for understanding FVM smart contracts. We are interacting with off-chain data sources like Wordnet dictionary and fetching keywords using Tellor.
