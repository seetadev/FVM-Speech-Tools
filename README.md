# Speech Tools
Developer Tools to enable conversational interface design with speech synthesis for the Filecoin eco-system dapps. Notification, task builder, notes dapp with Tableland, chainlink & Chainlink analytics tools.

# Details 

Speech Tools are developer tools that enables smart contract designers, developers and community managers to integrate speech synthesis, conversational interface and internationalization for their dapps.  

We have also used Tableland and Chainlink to create a task notifier and a reference notes dapp with the developer tooling module for speech synthesis enablement for Filecoin eco-system dapps. Chainlink services enables us to interact securely and obtain data from off-chain sources like OSS Wordnet dictionary.

Chainlink analytics toolkit enables data tabulation, organization, validation and visualization of on-chain data using an OSS spreadsheet.  Our toolkit enables a speech interface for dapp developers to integrate it within their solution as a low code framework to empower Web3 users via speech synthesis and internationalization.


# How we built it

We developed the speech synthesis toolkit using open source TTS (text to speech) engines, interface using JS frameworks and are developing on-chain integrations to hyperspace testnet and mainnet to support FVM based dapps. We also integrated an FVM analytics toolkit built using an OSS spreadsheet for data tabulation, organization, collaboration of FVM data.

We built the developer tooling for alarm and task notifiers, reference notes dapp using Tableland and OSS JS frameworks. This dapp serves as a notes section for the conversational interface for understanding FVM smart contracts. We are interacting with off-chain data sources like Wordnet dictionary and fetching keywords using Tellor.
