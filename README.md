Developer Tools to enable conversational interface design with speech synthesis for DeSci dapps using Fantom, AWS, Covalent APIs, Chainlink, FVM. Notification, task builder, notes dapp with Tableland.

FTM Speech Tools are developer tools that enables smart contract designers, developers and community managers to integrate speech synthesis, conversational interface and internationalization for their DeSci dapps.

## How we built it
We developed the speech synthesis toolkit using open source TTS (text to speech) engines, interface using JS frameworks and are developing on-chain integrations for DeSci dapps. We also integrated an analytics toolkit built using an OSS spreadsheet for data tabulation, organization, collaboration of data.
